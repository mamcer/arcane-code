Claude sonnet 3.5


I've implemented a complete Go program that fulfills the requirements from the assignment. Here's what the program does:

Command Line Interface:

Uses -c for encoding (codificar)
Uses -d for decoding (decodificar)
Takes two file arguments: morse code file and message file
File Handling:

Reads morse codes from a file in the format <letter>:<code>
Processes input files for encoding/decoding
Creates output files with appropriate extensions (.mor for encoded, .txt for decoded)
Features:

Bidirectional conversion (text â†” morse)
Proper word and letter spacing in morse code
Case-insensitive processing
Error handling for files and input
Usage Examples:

The program follows modern Go practices:

Uses proper error handling
Implements clean separation of concerns
Uses efficient string building
Provides clear usage messages
Follows Go naming conventions
